## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Documentation scaffolding: `CHANGELOG.md`, `NOTES.md`, and CLAUDE.md
  policies for keeping the changelog, notes, and `requirements.txt` current.
- CLAUDE.md conventions: broker-abstraction architecture rule; indicators as
  pluggable, toggleable chart modules.
- `chart/server.py` — Flask backend serving the chart + a JSON API
  (`/api/timeframes`, `/api/candles`) that reads the NQ parquets and returns the
  last 10,000 bars per timeframe (Unix-second UTC times), lru-cached.
- Timeframe selector (1m/5m/15m/60m/1d) in the chart header, wired to live NQ
  data with a bar-count status line.
- `chart/` frontend (TradingView Lightweight Charts, dark theme): candlesticks
  + volume histogram.
- `data/` pipeline (`build_data.py`) and clean NQ/ES parquets (gitignored).
- `.gitignore` excluding the large parquet data files.

### Changed
- Chart time axis and crosshair now use 12-hour format; removed the chart grid.
- Moved the chart frontend under `chart/` so the UI stays self-contained and
  reusable across tasks.
